## 🤔 The Problem

Early-stage investors are drowning in unstructured data: pitch decks, founder call transcripts, emails, and scattered news reports. Traditional analysis is:
- **Time-consuming**: Hours spent per startup
- **Inconsistent**: Subjective human analysis
- **Prone to error**: Critical red flags are easily missed
- **Non-scalable**: Impossible to evaluate hundreds of opportunities

## 💡 The Solution

**AI Analyst** acts as a tireless, expert investment associate. It ingests raw, unstructured founder materials and public data to generate **consistent, benchmarked, and actionable** deal memos in minutes, not hours.
